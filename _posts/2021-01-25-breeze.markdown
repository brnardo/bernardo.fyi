Breeze is an appointment scheduling digital tool I invested on with friends and helped on the product definition and launch. The challenge was taking an idea and a design for a minimalist solution to appointment scheduling to something a tech partner co-investing in the company could build upon. On the definition side of things the goal was:

- Complementing design mockups with edge cases, feedback mechanisms, design system and guidelines

- Documenting design specs with functional requirements for the tech partnerâ€™s development team

- Coordinating development, quality assurance and design

With a beta version ready in under two months the next challenge was launching the product for a first round of feedback from potential customers and everyone on our network knew used other scheduling apps, to then prepare a public launch:

- QA and UI testing to continue squashing bugs and polishing beta version while demoing product to prospects and beta users

- Complementing marketing site to clarify use cases and improve conversion based on early feedback

- Document and prioritise improvements on next versions of the product while defining launch strategy
