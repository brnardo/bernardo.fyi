DailyBot is a YC S21 company I worked with on two main fronts: auditing their current acquisition, activation and retention funnels and proposing a product strategy moving forward. While reviewing their funnel acquisition, activation and retention funnels, we analysed:

- Listed main organic and paid acquisition channels, prioritising by impact and conversion in order to source for alternatives

- Step by step conversion from sign up to active user to paid customer, identifying opportunities for improvement

- The aha-moment and activation signals leading to a user converting to a paid customer

Regarding product strategy the focus was on what would be next for DailyBot in order to widen their market now that product/market fit is clearer:

- Evaluate market and competitors to benchmark value proposition

- Propose two alternative strategies in how to deliver that proposition â€“ horizontally to the longer tail on a platform play or vertical by going upstream on enterprise

- Document and make a case for each of the scenarios with the respective arguments, product implications and outcomes deriving from both
