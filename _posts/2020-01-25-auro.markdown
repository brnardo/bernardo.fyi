Auro is a consumer and business local mobility company in Spain I advised on designing and launching their ride hailing service. I was approached by one of the partners in the company to collaborate with the in-house tech and leadership teams in the design and definition of their brand and app. After launching the brand with one of Spainâ€™s best studios we also collaborate with another of the local talents in product design to then build the product in-house:

- Iterate and coordinate on design based on feedback from leadership and tech teams together with studio

- Document and plan UI design implementation for iOS and Android in user stories to be developed by tech team, demoed to leadership and tested by employees with live fleet

- Lead product development and testing process along with managing stakeholders in leadership and design to work on early feedback and tests
